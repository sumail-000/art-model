# PixelMind-X Architecture

## Overview

PixelMind-X is an advanced AI system for multimodal understanding and image generation with continuous learning capabilities. This document outlines the technical architecture of the system.

## Core Components

### 1. Multimodal Understanding

The multimodal understanding component processes inputs from different modalities (text, image, voice, sketch) and maps them to a unified latent space.

#### 1.1 Hybrid Transformer-Diffusion Model

- **CLIPLikeEncoder**: A CLIP-inspired encoder that processes multiple modalities:
  - Text encoder based on CLIP-ViT
  - Vision encoder based on CLIP-ViT
  - Audio encoder based on Whisper
  - Sketch preprocessing and encoding
  
- **Architecture**:
  - Each modality is encoded independently
  - Projection layers map each modality to the same latent space
  - Learnable modality tokens help distinguish between embeddings
  - Normalization ensures consistency across modalities

#### 1.2 Dynamic Intent Parsing

- **DynamicIntentParser**: A module that interprets user intents from multimodal inputs:
  - Base model: Flan-T5-XL for powerful language understanding
  - Few-shot in-context learning for adaptability
  - RLHF components for refinement based on user feedback
  
- **Main Features**:
  - Maintains a memory of exemplars for few-shot learning
  - Incorporates multimodal embeddings into the generation process
  - Learns from user interactions with reinforcement learning

### 2. Generative Core

The generative core creates images through a hierarchical process, from low-resolution structure to high-resolution details.

#### 2.1 Hierarchical PixelGAN

- **Three-tier Generation Process**:
  - **ScaffoldNetwork (16x16)**: Creates the basic structure/composition
  - **RefinementNetwork**: Handles mid-resolution (64x64) and high-resolution (256x256) details
  - **AttentionGates**: Focus on important features during upsampling
  
- **Technical Details**:
  - Based on UNet with cross-attention for conditional generation
  - Uses diffusion process for high-quality outputs
  - Hierarchical approach enables both global structure and fine details

#### 2.2 Style Memory Bank

- **StyleMemoryBank**: Vector database for storing style preferences:
  - Uses FAISS/HNSW for efficient similarity search
  - Redis caching for fast lookups
  - Metadata storage for user associations
  
- **StyleEmbedder**: Neural network for embedding images into style vectors
  - Extracts style representations from images
  - Normalizes embeddings for consistent similarity calculations

### 3. Continuous Learning

The continuous learning component enables real-time adaptation to user preferences and intent.

#### 3.1 Online Meta-Learning (OML)

- **OnlineMetaLearning**: Adapts model parameters during user interactions:
  - Inner adaptation loop for fast updates
  - Meta-update for generalization across tasks
  - Higher-order gradients for optimization
  
- **MAMLWrapper**: Wrapper for model-agnostic meta-learning
  - Facilitates adaptation of specific modules
  - Maintains meta-parameters for quick adaptation

- **OnlineMetaLearningScheduler**: Controls when to perform meta-updates
  - Prioritizes tasks based on recency or importance
  - Maintains a buffer of tasks for replay

#### 3.2 Neural Turing Machine (NTM)

- **NeuralTuringMachine**: Provides long-term memory capabilities:
  - External memory matrix accessible through attention
  - Read/write heads for memory manipulation
  - Controller for processing inputs and outputs
  
- **HeadController**: Controls memory addressing:
  - Content-based addressing using similarity
  - Location-based addressing with shifting
  - Combined addressing for flexible memory access

### 4. Evaluation & Feedback

The evaluation and feedback components incorporate user feedback to improve outputs.

#### 4.1 Critic-Refiner Network

- **BiometricEncoder**: Processes biometric feedback:
  - Encodes eye tracking data
  - Encodes sentiment from user chat
  - Fuses multimodal biometric signals
  
- **CriticNetwork**: Predicts user satisfaction:
  - Analyzes image features and biometric data
  - Predicts satisfaction score and feedback categories
  
- **RefinerNetwork**: Optimizes outputs based on critic predictions:
  - Uses PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) for refinement
  - Multiple refinement layers with residual connections
  - Policy and value heads for RL training

#### 4.2 Feedback Integration

- **CriticRefinerSystem**: Combines critic and refiner:
  - Computes advantages using GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation)
  - Trains the critic to predict satisfaction
  - Updates the refiner using PPO
  - Provides deterministic or stochastic refinement

### 5. API & Integration

The API layer provides interfaces for external systems to interact with PixelMind-X.

#### 5.1 WebSocket Server

- **WebSocketServer**: Enables bidirectional communication:
  - Handles connection lifecycle
  - Manages user sessions
  - Processes different message types
  
- **Message Handlers**:
  - `handle_generate_image`: Progressive image generation
  - `handle_update_image`: Image refinement
  - `handle_feedback`: User feedback processing
  - `handle_chat_message`: Intent parsing
  - `handle_sketch_update`: Sketch processing
  - `handle_style_preference`: Style preference updates

## Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**:
   - User inputs (text, image, voice, sketch) are encoded into a unified latent space
   - Intent parser interprets the user's desired outcome

2. **Generation Pipeline**:
   - Scaffold network creates a low-resolution structure (16x16)
   - Mid-resolution network expands to 64x64 with more details
   - High-resolution network produces the final 256x256 image

3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - User provides explicit feedback (ratings, comments) or implicit feedback (biometrics)
   - Critic network predicts satisfaction based on feedback
   - Refiner network improves outputs using RL techniques
   - Online Meta-Learning adapts the model weights

4. **Long-term Learning**:
   - Style preferences are stored in the vector database
   - NTM maintains user-specific long-term memory
   - Model continually improves through meta-updates
